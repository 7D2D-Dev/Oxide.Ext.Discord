# ThreadListSyncEvent.ChannelIds property

The parent channel ids whose threads are being synced. If omitted, then threads were synced for the entire guild. This array may contain channel_ids that have no active threads as well, so you know to clear that data.

```csharp
public List<Snowflake> ChannelIds { get; set; }
```
