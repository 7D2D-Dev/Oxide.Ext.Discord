# DiscordMessage.Edit method

Edit a previously sent message. The fields content, embed, allowed_mentions and flags can be edited by the original message author. Other users can only edit flags and only if they have the MANAGE_MESSAGES permission in the corresponding channel. When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying. Only flags documented in the table below may be modified by users (unsupported flag changes are currently ignored without error). See [Edit Message](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#edit-message)

```csharp
public IPromise<DiscordMessage> Edit(DiscordClient client, MessageUpdate update)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| client | Client to use |
| update | Update to be applied to the message |
