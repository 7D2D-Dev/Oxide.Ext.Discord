# DiscordChannel.TriggerTypingIndicator method

Post a typing indicator for the specified channel. Generally bots should not implement this route. However, if a bot is responding to a command and expects the computation to take a few seconds, this endpoint may be called to let the user know that the bot is processing their message. See [Trigger Typing Indicator](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#trigger-typing-indicator)

```csharp
public IPromise TriggerTypingIndicator(DiscordClient client)
```

| parameter | description |
