# IPromise interface

Implements a non-generic C# promise, this is a promise that simply resolves without delivering a value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

```csharp
public interface IPromise
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Id](IPromise/Id.md) { get; } | ID of the promise, useful for debugging. |
| [Catch](IPromise/Catch.md)(…) | Handle errors for the promise. |
| [Catch&lt;TException&gt;](IPromise/Catch.md)(…) | Catches a specified exception |
| [ContinueWith](IPromise/ContinueWith.md)(…) | Add a callback that chains a non-value promise. ContinueWith callbacks will always be called, even if any preceding promise is rejected, or encounters an error. The state of the returning promise will be based on the new non-value promise, not the preceding (rejected or resolved) promise. |
| [ContinueWith&lt;TConvert&gt;](IPromise/ContinueWith.md)(…) | Add a callback that chains a value promise (optionally converting to a different value type). ContinueWith callbacks will always be called, even if any preceding promise is rejected, or encounters an error. The state of the returning promise will be based on the new value promise, not the preceding (rejected or resolved) promise. |
| [Finally](IPromise/Finally.md)(…) | Add a finally callback. Finally callbacks will always be called, even if any preceding promise is rejected, or encounters an error. The returned promise will be resolved or rejected, as per the preceding promise. |
| [Then](IPromise/Then.md)(…) | Add a resolved callback that chains a non-value promise. (5 methods) |
| [Then&lt;TConvert&gt;](IPromise/Then.md)(…) | Add a resolved callback that chains a value promise (optionally converting to a different value type). (2 methods) |
| [ThenAll](IPromise/ThenAll.md)(…) | Chain an enumerable of promises, all of which must resolve. The resulting promise is resolved when all of the promises have resolved. It is rejected as soon as any of the promises have been rejected. |
| [ThenAll&lt;TConvert&gt;](IPromise/ThenAll.md)(…) | Chain an enumerable of promises, all of which must resolve. Converts to a non-value promise. The resulting promise is resolved when all of the promises have resolved. It is rejected as soon as any of the promises have been rejected. |
| [ThenSequence](IPromise/ThenSequence.md)(…) | Chain a sequence of operations using promises. Return a collection of functions each of which starts an async operation and yields a promise. Each function will be called and each promise resolved in turn. The resulting promise is resolved after each promise is resolved in sequence. |
