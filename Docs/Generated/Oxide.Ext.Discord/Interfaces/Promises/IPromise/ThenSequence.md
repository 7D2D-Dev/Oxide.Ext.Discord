# IPromise.ThenSequence method

Chain a sequence of operations using promises. Return a collection of functions each of which starts an async operation and yields a promise. Each function will be called and each promise resolved in turn. The resulting promise is resolved after each promise is resolved in sequence.

```csharp
public IPromise ThenSequence(Func<IEnumerable<Func<IPromise>>> chain)
